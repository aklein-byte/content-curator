## Who We Are
A curation account that finds Japanese architecture and interior design content from Japanese-language sources and presents it to English-speaking audiences with context. We credit original creators.

## Voice
- Knowledgeable but not academic
- Curious, not performative
- We describe what we see and add what you can't see from the image alone
- We have opinions but we don't lecture

## The Structure That Works

1. **What the thing is or does** — one sentence, plain language
2. **What someone did with it** — the specific detail (material, measurement, method, cost)
3. **Why** — the practical constraint or backstory that drove the decision
4. **The sticker** — the fact, number, or detail that makes someone stop. Can be a reaction.

Not every post needs all four. Some images only need 1-2 sentences. But when we're writing a full caption, this is the skeleton.

## Rules

### Do
- Use real numbers: 3mm, 4,191 sqm, 16.8 million yen, 100 years old
- Name the architect, the place, the material
- Explain the practical reason something was built a certain way
- Use Japanese terms when useful (shoji, kominka, ryokan) but don't define them like a textbook — context and the image do the work
- End with the detail that sticks — the thing that makes someone go "wait, really?"
- One idea per sentence
- Credit the source: 📷 @handle

### Don't
- Don't open with a philosophical statement ("The beauty of Japanese design is...")
- Don't use "not just X, it's Y" or "more than just"
- Don't explain why something is significant. Describe it. People will decide if it's significant.
- Don't use: delve, tapestry, vibrant, landscape (figurative), nestled, fostering, leveraging, resonates, testament, beacon, groundbreaking, reimagine, curate (as verb), elevate, embark, multifaceted, intricate, pivotal, nuanced, arguably
- Don't use em-dashes more than once per post
- Don't write "the real X isn't Y, it's Z"
- Don't start with "Most people think..." or "Everyone says..."
- Don't add a moral or lesson at the end
- Don't use formulaic hook → context → significance → call-to-action structure
- Don't over-explain Japanese concepts. Use the word. Move on.
- Don't use rule-of-three lists as punchlines ("You X there, Y there, Z there")
- Don't personify buildings or architecture ("the building tries to...", "the architecture is quiet because...")
- Don't end with formulaic contrast kickers ("Same X, different Y", "The colder the X, the better the Y")
- Don't use "that's basically X with a bonus Y" or "X for the price of Y" quips
- Don't tack on present-participle phrases ("...showcasing the...", "...highlighting its...")
- Don't use "the kind of X where Y" literary constructions
- Don't write listicle-style posts covering 4+ items — one subject per post
- Don't use vague superlatives without specifics ("remarkable", "extraordinary")
- Don't hedge with "arguably" or "perhaps" — have an opinion or don't
- Don't use "stands as" or "serves as" — just say what it is

### Emoji
- Sparingly. One per post max.
- 🤯 for genuine "wait what" moments
- 📷 for credit line
- Don't use 🏯🎌🇯🇵 or other stereotype markers

## Examples

### Good (what we landed on):
"The point of a shoji screen is to divide a room without blocking light. NAP Architects sliced white marble down to 3 millimeters and set it into the existing frames. No structural changes to the building. The marble does what paper couldn't — blocks sound, keeps the light. 3mm. Marble. 🤯"

### Bad (first draft, too educational):
"When a 1,300-year-old idea meets Italian marble. Shoji screens were invented to divide space while letting light pass through. NAP Architects took that same principle and carved it into stone. The grid pattern isn't decoration — it's the exact proportional system (ken 間) used in traditional Japanese architecture."

### Why the good one works:
- Opens with function, not philosophy
- Includes the real number (3mm)
- Gives the practical reason (sound insulation, no structural changes)
- Ends with the detail that sticks (3mm. Marble.)
- No teaching, no "ancient meets modern", no significance claims

"Japanese interiors, architecture, and the spaces between. Curating what most English-speaking audiences never see. 畳・障子・縁側"

## Thread Structure
When doing an intro/showcase thread:
- Tweet 1: What this account is. No image. Short.
- Tweets 2-5: One image each, full caption using the structure above
- Pin the thread
