## Day 1 — Intro (pin this, no image)

> I keep finding Japanese architecture that most English-speaking audiences never see. Marble shoji screens, $110K thatched-roof houses in Kyoto, 100-year-old buildings turned into pop-up restaurants. Going to post what I find here.

## Day 2 — NAP Marble Shoji

> The point of a shoji screen is to divide a room without blocking light. NAP Architects sliced white marble down to 3 millimeters and set it into the existing frames. No structural changes to the building. The marble does what paper couldn't — blocks sound, keeps the light. 3mm. Marble. 🤯

> Thatched-roof folk house in Hirogawara, Kyoto. The hearth still works. The original fittings are untouched. The plot is 4,191 sqm and the whole thing is listed for 16.8 million yen — roughly $110K. A century-old house on an acre of Kyoto land for the price of a Tesla.

## Day 4 — Ryokan

> This ryokan is a 100-year-old house that was converted instead of rebuilt. The bones are original. They didn't modernize it into something unrecognizable — they let the building stay what it was and built the inn around it.

## Day 5 — Kudanshita Pop-Up Restaurant

> 100-year-old kominka near Kudanshita Station, central Tokyo. Sitting in a redevelopment zone, scheduled for demolition. The lights went dark for months. Then a restaurant called 酒とてらだや opened inside — for one year only, until the building comes down. The building gets one more year. The neighborhood gets to say goodbye.
